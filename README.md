Angular Test Tool Box
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jdalt/angular-test-tool-box.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jdalt/angular-test-tool-box.svg?branch=master)

Angular test helpers injected as an angular module.

This module is an attempt to standardize the way a component based (basically: directives) Angular application is tested. By grouping methods as a set of factories that can be injected in tests, you can avoid making global test helpers and eliminate singnificant amounts of boiler plate to just get down to the business of testing your application.
